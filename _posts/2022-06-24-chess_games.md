# Chess Games

I'm pretty new to chess, just started playing a lot this year. I have some background in tactics from the 'chess tactics' app, that my dad and I were very competitive with, but still have a lot to learn. 

I'll post when I beat a person or a computer above 1600 level.

Pablo is a 1600 level computer that I frequently loose against. My chess goal is to beat him frequently. I won today, but I think he usually plays stronger.
